# personWebPage
Personal Webpage using MySQL, PHP, and HTML
For this project, you have to have XAMPP for this work. (Maybe another website can work for this project but I used XAMPP for this as it has MySQL!).
- After downloading XAMPP, I opened it up and click on "go to application". Afterwards, I went to phpMyAdmin and I clicked on SQL!
- Then I copied and pasted the content that are in both contentEdit.sql and registeredUsers.sql, and pasted it into the textbox in the SQL screen!
- Lastly, download the other files and the webpage should work! Let me know if it doesn't by direct messaging me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenadarwiche/) ! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíï
 - This is how the webpage is suppose to look like: [Personal Web Page] (https://luluswebsite.000webhostapp.com/homepage.html)
